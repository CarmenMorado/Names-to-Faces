# Names-to-Faces
100 Days of Swift (Project 10) A simple and useful project that allows the user to create an app that stores the names of people they've met.
Throughout the course of this project, I became acquainted with UICollectionView, UICollectionViewCell, UIImagePickerController, NSObject, and more. 

In addition, I completed the following challenges:
-Add a second UIAlertController that gets shown when the user taps a picture, asking them whether they want to rename the person or delete them.
-Try using picker.sourceType = .camera when creating your image picker, which will tell it to create a new image by taking a photo. This is only 
available on devices (not on the simulator) so you might want to check the return value of UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable() before 
trying to use it!
-Modify project 1 so that it uses a collection view controller rather than a table view controller. I recommend you keep a copy of your original 
table view controller code so you can refer back to it later on.
